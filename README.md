## General

This mobile app is a personal project aiming to help myself practicing advanced memory techniques that are taught by the international memory expert Eran Katz.

In the future, the app will also support a practice of imagery memory, dates, phone numbers and more . In addition, it will be adjusted to help everyone :
- Children who want to enhance cognitive skills
- Memory enthusiasts who want to proceed to the next level
- Adults who want to keep the mind sharp
